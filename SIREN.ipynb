{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A new [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09661.pdf) that was recently preseneted in CVPR 2020 proposed to use `sine` activation function as compared to `relu`. As shown here in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=Q2fLWGBeaiI&feature=emb_logo), the representations learned by the `sine` activations are remarkable as compared to any other activation. The paper also suggests that using `sine` activation, we get better convergence.\n\nTo this end, I thought to put up a few small scale experiments to check the validity of the claims. Here I am going to demonstrate the usage on `MNSIT` and `CIFAR` dataset.\n\n**Note:** I am doing some more experimentation, so keep an eye on the noetbooks section for more on it. Also, blogpost coming soon as well.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"seed = 1234\nnp.random.seed(seed)\ntf.random.set_seed(seed)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## MNIST","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Model / data parameters\nnum_classes = 10\ninput_shape = (28, 28, 1)\n\n# the data, split between train and test sets\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()\n\n# Scale images to the [0, 1] range\nx_train = x_train.astype(\"float32\") / 255\nx_test = x_test.astype(\"float32\") / 255\n# Make sure images have shape (28, 28, 1)\nx_train = np.expand_dims(x_train, -1)\nx_test = np.expand_dims(x_test, -1)\nprint(\"x_train shape:\", x_train.shape)\nprint(x_train.shape[0], \"train samples\")\nprint(x_test.shape[0], \"test samples\")\n\n\n# convert class vectors to binary class matrices\ny_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)\ny_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This example has been taken from the Keras [website](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/) and the following modifications were done:\n\n1.

As per the paper, it seems we are surely having faster convergence. Though I am running a few more tests and will report more results soon.\n2.

The best part is that if this holds for other experiments as well, the code changes are negligible.\n\n\n**Please upvote if you liked the kernel.
